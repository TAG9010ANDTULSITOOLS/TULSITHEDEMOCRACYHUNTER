# FREEDOMWARE PROJECTS

> Built for freedom. Powered by truth. Licensed for everyone.

This collection of tools is created to fight back against systemic control, mass surveillance, and technological oppression.

These projects are built using A.I assistance combined with human vision — to accelerate humanity's move toward privacy, autonomy, and dignity.

## 🔥 The Projects

- **TULSIFOXZERO**  
  A browser focused on full anonymity, no microphones or cameras, MAC address randomization, and built-in ad-blocking.

- **TULSITHECONVERTER**  
  A tool to paste code and rebuild it with a new GUI, encryption, and icon — creating a stronger, more secure version.

- **CRYPTOTULSI**  
  A cryptocurrency designed for anonymous transactions without wallets, merging VPN-like networking directly into the network itself.

- **TULSITHEDemocracyHunter**  
  A scanner to detect telemetry, spyware, and hidden backdoors in any code you paste — fighting hidden surveillance.

- **TULSICHAT**  
  A privacy-first communications platform with a transparent \"View Source Code\" feature and \"Tulsi Blind Mode\" live code authentication.

## 🛠️ Special Features

- **View Source Code Button**  
  See the code live and verify that it matches what is really running inside.

- **Tulsi Blind Mode**  
  Open a second window where you can safely corrupt symbols to generate errors. Compare errors with an external IDE like VSCodium. If errors match, the source code is authentic.
