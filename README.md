	The programs I am TRYING to create are the following and all of those are under MIT license….

	TULSITHEDEMOCRACYHUNTER …. this is a program that will allow us to copy paste any code and scan it to see if it is clean from spyware/malware/back doors and so on
 
	TULSITHECONVERTER …. this is a program that will allow us to copy paste there any code and convert it into a usable app with new encryption new icon and new GUI resulting in a new and totally different version of the original code 

	TULSIFOXZERO…. This is a browser that is focusing on privacy. It have as characteristic to not log any information while it have a build in adblocker and also it is not having access to any input devices like microphones, camera and so on…also it is changing the MAC address !  it is basically only to surf the web and do nothing more than that for security reasons….

	TULSICHAT…. Is a messaging app that will allow us to communicate with people without any registration and without any use of email or phone number…. It will use a combination of hashes from randomization together with an alias to find the other person we want to talk to him/her while at the same time the communications will be end to end encrypted 
	
 
	CRYPTOTULSI…. This is a cryptocurrency combined with VPN fully anonymous with zero knowledge…. This network is intent to be “on-air” without wallets and so on to maximize security and anonymity by giving the ability to the people to trade/send/get their cryptocurrency from random devices if they need to while also at the same time the cryptocurrency it self is to be mined from any device under any operating system !

	ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS… have a special button(view Tulsi’s code)  that is allowing us to view the code of any of those programs from inside out…. This will help us to get rid the burden of democracy ! 

	ALL OF THOSE PROGRAMS…. Have another special button after we see “view Tulsi’s code” and the name of this is “Tulsi in blind mode”…. This is aiming on making absolutely sure that the code we see is indeed the code of the program we use by allowing us to edit the code without saving it by adding comments, symbols and deleting things like letters libraries and entire lines so we will cause errors on the code on purpose !
 
	Then this way we will be able to copy paste the new code with the errors on VScodium or another program like VScodium and if the errors are identical then the code must likely is authentic and correct without the BS of Democracy ! 

	This is hard to be done and I got tired of trying the same thing over and over again because every time I have a million bugs whenever I am trying to complete it ! But if we manage to complete this then we will get rid of these idiots who want to take our privacy so they will control us and keep us poor !  

	NO ONE of these programs is complete and they need further testing, bug fixes and several upgrades ! All of those programs are aiming to secure our privacy and having the ability soon to create our own micro societies that are more suitable to us while having minimum interaction with the government !
 

	FURTHER MORE because we can not trust the government I need to mention that I used A.I to help me create those things and I don’t know if this A.I is capable of putting hidden back-doors on any new code…. So please be careful ! Be suspicious and do not trust anything ! 

	PERSONAL NOTE… although I want my programs to be absolutely free and open source for everyone to use as they want I believe we need to update all those licenses that exist like MIT BSD Apache and so on to our modern environment….
 
	Whoever is updating those licenses must take under consideration the threats of Democracy and Theocracy that exist and plaguing the world with wars poverty misery and corruption to every level  in society !

 	WE MUST UPDATE THOSE LICENSES in such a way from stopping those motherfuckers been a threat to our free world ! 
	We must understand that those traitors of the free world who want to put us all in the same box in order to install back-doors and spyware everywhere are actually thinking to made several of those projects illegal while claiming that they are doing it to “protect the children” ! 
	They actually show us their weak spot with their claims that they are trying to “protect the children” as they are trying to made illegal every free and open source project and program…. 
	
	WE MUST EXPLOIT THIS WEAK SPOT THEY HAVE ASAP by actually modifying those licenses like MIT BSD Apache and whatever else exist to do the same thing like what they are already do but at the same time they must say clearly that these licenses are valid only if we do the following things within every operating system on Desktop, Laptops, Servers and Smartphones !

	The following things those licenses must do are the following…

	To actually force every program to have these buttons like “View Tulsi’s code” and “Tulsi in blind mode” so people will see the code of the program they use from inside out and made sure this way that the program don’t have any BS like spyware and back-doors inside from the government and confirm that it is clean from Democracy ! 

	The other thing those license must say is that in order for their license to be valid on their free and open source operating system it must have one regulation in particular that will help us to get rid of Democracy from our systems !

	This regulation will be a simple built in A.I that will work as facial recognition to scan the pictures and the videos with the purpose to detect children…. The moment this A.I find any children then it will destroy the entire operating system… 
	further more the same A.I must be able to search and detect for religious content and again if it finds anything that is related to ANY religion in words and pictures or videos it must destroy the entire operating system on its own ! 

	This way with this built-in A.I we will have every right to do whatever else we want, without the presence of Democracy in our systems simply because we will eliminate this way every content that is related to those things fucked up things, from every operating system and possible the entire internet too ! 
	And we will humiliate the government really well because with this simple solution we will solve a problem that the government claims she wants to solve…
	And also we will have a true chance to see the true face of the government too… we will expose their lies and so on if they try to work around our new licenses or try to regulate again any free and open source program/project/operating system ! If they do anything against us again after we put this built-in A.I in particular we should understand the government as a threat !
	Also the new updates on those license must encourage people to demand more from companies and the government too in regards to free and open source software and hardware too…. 
	More in particular we should aim on forcing somehow those companies made free and open source any old product they have in terms of software and hardware so we will modify it as we want and give a new life to those things… this will expand and secure even better our privacy and security because we will unlock new options and then we can have more devices running under a secure free and open source operating system without the BS of Democracy… we will be able to have smartphones with secure free and open source operating systems if we do this ! 

	Another thing we must do with those licenses is to actually say that in order for those license to be valid then the operating system must work on every device no matter in what condition the hardware of that device is ! This sound general speaking but it is aiming to made sure that an operating system will work on a laptop that is missing hardware…. 

	This is important because we will be able to have easy installation on devices that are missing things like microphones speakers camera blue-tooth and so on to enhance our privacy ! 
	I feel like I have to talk about this thing in particular because when I did this kind of shit on some of my laptops I discover that I can not install successfully many of linux operating systems…
	it took me months till I figure out something and eventually I discover some operating systems after a lot of search that can work on a laptop like this…. DEVUAN THANK YOU ! 

	Finally we must update those licenses to do have the following feature too… normally I can talk for ever in regards to how those licenses must update but I will stop here with this one in the end because when I was experimenting with A.I I was trying to create apps that will encrypt the entire operating system almost like how ransomware is doing without been an actual ransomware ! 
	And the A.I actually refuses to help me…. after a long conversation in my effort to force it to help me do that it said that the use of “dual end” technology is “illegal to use because it can be used for malicious things” … it was something like that and I don’t remember exactly because this happened long ago !
	Careful now…. I was telling to it that I don’t plan to do anything malicious or bad and the purpose on why we need this thing to be done is to increase security because we must block the operating system from reading the new app or taking screenshots from our program ! 
	I was thinking that “ok if we use end to end encryption in an messaging app then how do we know that our communications are not been intercepted by the operating system via screenshots especially if both end users are using the same operating system?” 
	and after at some point the more I was talking to that A.I the more it refuses to help me to the point it was answering in every question “I cant help with that” …. so we must assume that Democracy is actually taking screenshots of whatever we do many years now of whatever we do without us knowing us ! 
	So the new licenses for free and open source software like MIT BSD Apache and whatever else exist must encourage the use of “dual end” technology or whatever this shit is to made sure that the app or program we are using will encrypt the entire operating system so we will keep safe whatever we do ! 

	This way we will revolutionize every app and made them really secure and really private while sending those traitors of the free world far away from us because it will be harder for them to spy on us and keep us poor ! 

	This way we will revolutionize everything by making everything really secure and private while at the same time we will have real support from the enemy elite it self especially if they learn that banking industry is using this technology too on their banking apps since this way it will be less likely for their enemy who is our enemy too ,to know what we do, where we are talking to,what we are thinking, what our plan is, how much money we have, what is our social status and so on ! 
	The masses eventually will understand that in order for them to have a good life is to actually take care of their personal lives and ignore the government especially when they realize that the government is offering nothing to them ! 

	Can the government do better ? ABSOLUTELY ! The role of the government should be to keep the society solid, with rules and freedoms so everyone will be happy and do whatever they want in life as long they don’t harming anyone ! 
	For the government and especially the US GOVERNMENT TO DO THIS all they have to do is to stop spying on the masses while leaving us the fuck alone to live our life as we want ! 
	This way eventually everyone will end up living in his own ideal environment that is more suitable for them resulting on making the work of the government easier on making a utopia ! 

	And the irony here is that the government might now already the solutions simple because they know everything after this monstrosity they created ! All they have to do is to scan in their fancy data server for solutions that people are talking about and they ignore many years now instead of who is against the whatever political agenda they are serving at any time ! 

	Tulsi Gabbard can do exactly this and this is why I named every program I made with her name… it is for her to see that we are just around the edge to turn our backs and ignore the government…. 
	We will be fine if this happens however it will be wise to actually made the government to change in really unique ways to benefit everyone rather than the elite only so we will not need to rediscover the wheel in our quest to re-engineer society again ! 

	Tulsi Gabbard is the “all seeing eye” so probably together with the bad things she can also see the good things too… all she have to do is to collect them in a USB, filtered them and give them to Trump so she will made TRUMP GREAT AGAIN and change the world this way ! 

ON TULSI WE TRUST !
